It’s not a designer brand, nor is it particularly stylish. But it is a symbol of something greater. This T-shirt is from LeetCode, a popular platform for coding challenges, and it is not something you can just swipe your card and buy at the store. In fact, the price of this T-shirt is not in rupees or dollars or any other currency. The price is in patience, dedication, and perseverance. In this blog post, we will explore what it takes to earn the LeetCode T-shirt and why it’s more than just a piece of clothing.

LeetCode is a platform that provides users with coding challenges, ranging from easy to hard, that are designed to improve their programming skills. Users are rewarded with points for completing challenges, participating in contests, and checking in daily. Daily Challenge - Every day you solve a Daily Challenge, you get 10 points. These challenges are usually one or two questions that test your knowledge of a specific topic, such as arrays, strings, or algorithms. Check-in - Every day you check in, you get 1 point. Checking in is a simple task that involves logging into your LeetCode account and confirming that you are still active on the platform. Monthly Challenge - If you complete all the daily challenges in a given month, you get 50 points. This is a great way to challenge yourself and stay motivated to complete the daily challenges. Contests - LeetCode hosts weekly and biweekly coding contests, and participating in these contests can earn you points. You get 5 points for participating in a contest, and if you participate in both the weekly and biweekly contests, you get an additional 35 points. Bonus Points - LeetCode also awards bonus points for various achievements, such as solving a difficult challenge or helping other users on the platform.

The answer is 6,000 points. That may seem like a lot, but it’s not impossible. With daily dedication and perseverance, you can earn this coveted T-shirt. To put this into perspective, let’s do the math. If you solve the daily challenge every day and check-in every day for a month, you will earn 310 points (10 points x 30 days + 1 point x 30 days). If you participate in every weekly and biweekly contest for a month, you will earn an additional 40 points (5 points x 4 contests + 35 points). And if you complete all the daily challenges in that month, you will earn 50 bonus points. That’s a total of 400 points in one month. If you continue this pace for a year, you will have earned 4,800 points. Add in some bonus points and you’re well on your way to earning the LeetCode T-shirt. Of course, this is just an example, and you can earn points at your own pace. The key is to stay dedicated and motivated.

Coding questions are a great way to improve your programming skills, whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer. Here are a few reasons why: Coding is an art and science that requires both creativity and logic. It is a field where continuous learning is necessary to keep up with the rapidly evolving technologies. One of the best ways to sharpen your coding skills is by solving coding problems. Not only does it improve your problem-solving abilities, but it also enhances your creativity, logical reasoning, and critical thinking. Coding problems can be solved in various programming languages, making it possible for coders to explore new programming languages and frameworks. By solving coding problems in different languages, you gain a deeper understanding of how different programming languages work, their strengths, and weaknesses. Moreover, coding problems are an excellent way to test your coding knowledge and measure your progress. You can easily track your progress by keeping track of the number of problems you’ve solved and how much time you took to solve them. This way, you can set benchmarks and measure your improvement over time. Another significant benefit of coding problems is that they help you prepare for coding interviews. The coding interview process is tough, and solving coding problems beforehand can help you prepare for the types of questions that may be asked. The more coding problems you solve, the more familiar you become with the coding patterns and the better equipped you are to tackle complex problems during interviews. One of the reasons LeetCode is so popular is that it has a vast collection of coding problems that cover a wide range of topics, making it an excellent platform for coders to sharpen their skills. The platform offers both easy and complex problems, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced coders. In addition to the LeetCode platform, there are numerous other platforms and resources available for coders to practice and improve their skills. Some of the popular ones include HackerRank, CodeChef, Project Euler, and many more. In conclusion, coding problems are an excellent way to improve your coding skills, and platforms like LeetCode make it easy for coders to sharpen their skills. While the journey to earn the coveted LeetCode T-shirt may be long and challenging, the skills and knowledge you gain along the way are invaluable. So, if you’re a coder looking to enhance your skills, start solving coding problems today and take the first step towards becoming a better programmer.
