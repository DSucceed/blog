In this world, we have a generic car called GenericCar. It has certain characteristics and behaviors that are common to all cars, such as the number of wheels and the ability to move in different directions. Here’s an example of how it can be defined in code: public class GenericCar { int noOfWheels = 4; public void moveW() { System.out.println(\"Flooring it Yo!\"); } public void moveS() { System.out.println(\"Stopping\"); } public void moveA() { System.out.println(\"Left Turn\"); } public void moveD() { System.out.println(\"Right Turn\"); } } In the code above, we have a class called GenericCar that represents a generic car. It has a property noOfWheels set to 4, and several methods to perform different movements such as moving forward, stopping, turning left, and turning right. Now, let’s say we have a specific type of car called MercedesEQS which is a hybrid model. This car inherits all the properties and behaviors of the GenericCar class but also has some additional features specific to the MercedesEQS model. Here’s an example of how it can be defined: public class MercesdesEQS extends GenericCar { String name = \"Mercedes EQS Hybrid\"; public void hybrid() { System.out.println(\"Hybrid Mode Engaged! I Save Money!\"); } public void sport() { System.out.println(\"Sport Mode Engaged! I Go Bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu......!\"); } } In the code above, we have a class called MercedesEQS which extends the GenericCar class. It inherits the properties and behaviors of the GenericCar class, such as the noOfWheels property and the moveW(), moveS(), moveA(), and moveD() methods. Additionally, it has its own unique features, such as the hybrid() and sport() methods. Now, let’s see how we can use inheritance to access the methods of the parent class and the additional methods of the child class. Here’s an example: public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Using Inheritance\"); MercesdesEQS model1 = new MercesdesEQS(); System.out.println(\"Features of \" + model1.name); model1.hybrid(); model1.moveW(); model1.sport(); } } Output: Using Inheritance Features of Mercedes EQS Hybrid Hybrid Mode Engaged! I Save Money! Flooring it Yo! Sport Mode Engaged! I Go Bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu......! In the code above, we create an instance of the MercedesEQS class called model1. We can access the methods inherited from the GenericCar class, such as moveW(), as well as the additional methods specific to the MercedesEQS class, such as hybrid() and sport(). This demonstrates how inheritance allows child classes to inherit properties and behaviors from parent classes, providing code reusability and extensibility.

It allows us to write code that can work with objects of different classes as long as they share a common interface or superclass. To illustrate polymorphism, let’s consider a world where motorcycles are represented as objects in a Java program. We have a parent class called GenericBike that defines common characteristics and behaviors of all bikes. Here’s an example: public class GenericBike { int numOfWheels = 2; String name; public void start() { System.out.println(\"Ignition ON! Engine Running @ 1.5k RPM\"); } public GenericBike(String name) { this.name = name; } public GenericBike() { this.name = \"generic bike\"; } } In the code above, we have a class called GenericBike that represents a generic bike. It has a property numOfWheels set to 2 and a method start() to start the bike’s engine. It also has two constructors, one that takes a name parameter and another default constructor. Now, let’s define some child classes that inherit from the GenericBike class. These child classes represent specific bike models and provide their own implementations for the start() method. Here are a couple of examples: public class Kawasaki extends GenericBike { public Kawasaki(String name) { super(name); } public void start() { System.out.println(\"Ignition ON! Engine Running @ 2.5K RPM\"); } } public class YamahaVmax extends GenericBike { public YamahaVmax(String name) { super(name); } public void start(int rpm) { System.out.println(\"Ignition ON! Engine Running @ \" + rpm + \" RPM\"); } } In the code above, we have two child classes: Kawasaki and YamahaVmax. Both classes extend the GenericBike class and provide their own implementations for the start() method. The Kawasaki class starts the engine at 2.5K RPM, while the YamahaVmax class allows specifying the RPM as a parameter. Now, let’s see how polymorphism allows us to use objects of different classes interchangeably. Here’s an example: public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // Using Polymorphism GenericBike splender = new GenericBike(\"Splender\"); System.out.println(\"I am \" + splender.name); splender.start(); Kawasaki z900 = new Kawasaki(\"Z900\"); System.out.println(\"I am \" + z900.name); z900.start(); YamahaVmax vmax = new YamahaVmax(\"Yamaha VMAX\"); System.out.println(\"I am \" + vmax.name); vmax.start(1150); } } Output: I am Splender Ignition ON! Engine Running @ 1.5k RPM I am Z900 Ignition ON! Engine Running @ 2.5K RPM I am Yamaha VMAX Ignition ON! Engine Running @ 1150 RPM In the code above, we create objects of different classes (GenericBike, Kawasaki, and YamahaVmax) but store them in variables of the parent class type (GenericBike). This allows us to treat them interchangeably and call the start() method without knowing the specific class of the object. This is the power of polymorphism, where objects can take on different forms while still exhibiting the same behavior.

It focuses on the “what” rather than the “how,” enabling us to work with high-level concepts and ignore the intricate details. In our world of vehicles, let’s consider an abstract class called Vehicle that defines the common properties and behaviors of all vehicles. Here’s an example: public abstract class Vehicle { int numOfWheels; String name; public Vehicle(int numOfWheels, String name) { this.numOfWheels = numOfWheels; this.name = name; } public abstract void start(); public void stop() { System.out.println(\"Vehicle stopped!\"); } } In the code above, we have an abstract class called Vehicle. It has properties numOfWheels and name, as well as abstract method start() and a concrete method stop(). The start() method is declared as abstract, meaning it doesn’t provide any implementation in the abstract class and must be implemented by any concrete subclasses. Now, let’s create a concrete subclass called Car that extends the Vehicle class and provides its own implementation for the start() method. Here’s an example: public class Car extends Vehicle { public Car(String name) { super(4, name); } public void start() { System.out.println(\"Car engine started!\"); } } In the code above, we have a Car class that extends the Vehicle class. It provides an implementation for the start() method, specific to a car’s engine. Now, let’s see how abstraction allows us to work with high-level concepts without worrying about the specific implementation details. Here’s an example: public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // Using Abstraction Vehicle vehicle = new Car(\"BMW\"); System.out.println(\"I am a \" + vehicle.name); vehicle.start(); vehicle.stop(); } } Output: I am a BMW Car engine started! Vehicle stopped! In the code above, we create an object of the Car class and store it in a variable of the Vehicle type. By doing this, we can interact with the object using the Vehicle interface, which includes the start() and stop() methods, without knowing the specific class or implementation details of the object. This allows us to work with abstract concepts and focus on what the object can do, rather than how it does it.

It aims to protect the internal state of an object from external interference by providing controlled access to the object’s properties and behaviors. In our vehicle world, let’s consider a class called Vehicle that encapsulates the properties numOfWheels and name using private access modifiers. Here’s an example: public class Vehicle { private int numOfWheels; private String name; public Vehicle(int numOfWheels, String name) { this.numOfWheels = numOfWheels; this.name = name; } public int getNumOfWheels() { return numOfWheels; } public String getName() { return name; } public void start() { System.out.println(\"Vehicle started!\"); } public void stop() { System.out.println(\"Vehicle stopped!\"); } } In the code above, we have a class called Vehicle with private properties numOfWheels and name. To provide controlled access to these properties, we have defined public getter methods (getNumOfWheels() and getName()) that allow other classes to retrieve their values. The start() and stop() methods provide public access to the vehicle’s behaviors. Now, let’s see how encapsulation helps protect the internal state of an object. Here’s an example: public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // Using Encapsulation Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle(4, \"Tesla\"); System.out.println(\"I am a \" + vehicle.getName()); System.out.println(\"I have \" + vehicle.getNumOfWheels() + \" wheels\"); vehicle.start(); vehicle.stop(); } } Output: I am a Tesla I have 4 wheels Vehicle started! Vehicle stopped! In the code above, we create an object of the Vehicle class and use the public getter methods (getName() and getNumOfWheels()) to retrieve the values of its private properties. This allows us to access the necessary information about the object while keeping the internal state protected from direct external modification. Encapsulation helps maintain data integrity, improves code maintainability, and promotes modular development. And that wraps up our journey through the pillars of object-oriented programming: inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. These concepts provide a solid foundation for creating flexible, reusable, and well-organized code. Remember to have fun while exploring these concepts and continue building amazing software solutions!

LeetCode is a platform that provides users with coding challenges, ranging from easy to hard, that are designed to improve their programming skills. Users are rewarded with points for completing challenges, participating in contests, and checking in daily. Daily Challenge - Every day you solve a Daily Challenge, you get 10 points. These challenges are usually one or two questions that test your knowledge of a specific topic, such as arrays, strings, or algorithms. Check-in - Every day you check in, you get 1 point. Checking in is a simple task that involves logging into your LeetCode account and confirming that you are still active on the platform. Monthly Challenge - If you complete all the daily challenges in a given month, you get 50 points. This is a great way to challenge yourself and stay motivated to complete the daily challenges. Contests - LeetCode hosts weekly and biweekly coding contests, and participating in these contests can earn you points. You get 5 points for participating in a contest, and if you participate in both the weekly and biweekly contests, you get an additional 35 points. Bonus Points - LeetCode also awards bonus points for various achievements, such as solving a difficult challenge or helping other users on the platform.

The answer is 6,000 points. That may seem like a lot, but it’s not impossible. With daily dedication and perseverance, you can earn this coveted T-shirt. To put this into perspective, let’s do the math. If you solve the daily challenge every day and check-in every day for a month, you will earn 310 points (10 points x 30 days + 1 point x 30 days). If you participate in every weekly and biweekly contest for a month, you will earn an additional 40 points (5 points x 4 contests + 35 points). And if you complete all the daily challenges in that month, you will earn 50 bonus points. That’s a total of 400 points in one month. If you continue this pace for a year, you will have earned 4,800 points. Add in some bonus points and you’re well on your way to earning the LeetCode T-shirt. Of course, this is just an example, and you can earn points at your own pace. The key is to stay dedicated and motivated.

Coding questions are a great way to improve your programming skills, whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer. Here are a few reasons why: Coding is an art and science that requires both creativity and logic. It is a field where continuous learning is necessary to keep up with the rapidly evolving technologies. One of the best ways to sharpen your coding skills is by solving coding problems. Not only does it improve your problem-solving abilities, but it also enhances your creativity, logical reasoning, and critical thinking. Coding problems can be solved in various programming languages, making it possible for coders to explore new programming languages and frameworks. By solving coding problems in different languages, you gain a deeper understanding of how different programming languages work, their strengths, and weaknesses. Moreover, coding problems are an excellent way to test your coding knowledge and measure your progress. You can easily track your progress by keeping track of the number of problems you’ve solved and how much time you took to solve them. This way, you can set benchmarks and measure your improvement over time. Another significant benefit of coding problems is that they help you prepare for coding interviews. The coding interview process is tough, and solving coding problems beforehand can help you prepare for the types of questions that may be asked. The more coding problems you solve, the more familiar you become with the coding patterns and the better equipped you are to tackle complex problems during interviews. One of the reasons LeetCode is so popular is that it has a vast collection of coding problems that cover a wide range of topics, making it an excellent platform for coders to sharpen their skills. The platform offers both easy and complex problems, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced coders. In addition to the LeetCode platform, there are numerous other platforms and resources available for coders to practice and improve their skills. Some of the popular ones include HackerRank, CodeChef, Project Euler, and many more. In conclusion, coding problems are an excellent way to improve your coding skills, and platforms like LeetCode make it easy for coders to sharpen their skills. While the journey to earn the coveted LeetCode T-shirt may be long and challenging, the skills and knowledge you gain along the way are invaluable. So, if you’re a coder looking to enhance your skills, start solving coding problems today and take the first step towards becoming a better programmer.
